DIGITAL PENDULUM DATA ANALYSIS					Bradley Klee
Version 1.1                  					(AtomBlau4861A)

Dependencies: Python, Gnuplot, xdotool (optional)

Description: 
		Using a USB mouse and xdotool, we obtain 100 trials of 
		amplitude vs. time data, and store "./Data/100Trials.csv". This 
		program redacts data and performs recursive analysis to determine 
		the expansion coefficients of EllipticK(m). For more explanation, 
		see arxiv articles [1,2].

File Tree:
		.		mostly run files
		./Data		data files
		./Output	processed log, plots
		./Style		splash / animation ASCII	
		
		Note: file tree can be changed by setting PROGRAMBASE and OUTBASE 
			in the python and bash files. Automated by config + inst. 
			In Arch Linux, file tree automated by PKGBUILD.
			

Runtime Instructions:
		Run './PendulumData' and input meta-analysis dependant 
		parameters. Processed fit log and plots are saved in './Output'.
